Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline with Apache Kafka, Python & Cassandra on AWS EC2
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline that captures live stock market data using Python, streams it through Apache Kafka deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, and stores the data into Apache Cassandra for persistence. It is designed for low-latency, high-throughput, and scalable ingestion of financial data.

Key Features
Data Engineering: Implements an end-to-end streaming pipeline for real-time data.

Technology Stack: Python, Apache Kafka, CassandraDB, AWS EC2.

Cloud Integration: Kafka is deployed on AWS EC2 for flexibility and scalability.

Resilience: Includes error handling for common integration issues.

Extendability: Allows future integration of ML models, dashboards, and alerts.

OS: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

Specs: 4 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 32 GB Disk

Role: Hosts Apache Cassandra

AWS EC2
OS: Amazon Linux 2 (Kernel 5.10)

Instance Type: t2.micro

Role: Runs Kafka broker, producer, and consumer scripts

 Prerequisites
Install the following on relevant environments:

Python 3.x

kafka-python

cassandra-driver

Apache Kafka

Apache Cassandra

Java (JDK)

AWS CLI

s Implementation Steps
Provision EC2 Instance

Launch EC2 using Amazon Linux 2

Install Java and Apache Kafka

Configure firewall (open port 9092)

Kafka Producer (Python)

Fetch stock market data from an API

Send it to Kafka topic using kafka-python

Kafka Broker

Start Zookeeper and Kafka server

Create a topic (e.g., stock_data)

Kafka Consumer (Python)

Consume data from the Kafka topic

Write data into Cassandra using cassandra-driver

Cassandra DB

Create keyspace and tables

Use CQL to validate data writes

 Execution Steps
Start Kafka on EC2

Run producer script to publish data

Run consumer script to save data to Cassandra

Query Cassandra with CQL to verify results
